              <p>There&#8217;s an accepted sort of conventional coastal elitism
              that views anything west of the Appalachian Mountains but east of the Sierra
              Nevada&#8217;s as impossibly outdated. Technology is born in Silicon Valley and
              Washington State, it flies to New York City and Washington D.C., and 20 years
              down the road, if they&#8217;re lucky, it shows up for use on Main St. If you believe
              that, go play Fortnite in Bismark, North Dakota, and be surprised.</p>

              <p>Even without knowing where it is or without the state
              outline in the map above, North Dakota is easy to spot because its internet
              speeds separate it from its neighbors. Most Midwestern and Mountain states are
              dominated by connection speeds between 0 and 20 Mbps, with many census tracts
              on the lower end of that range. North Dakota, however, sees rural tracts
              breaking 40 Mbps.</p>

              <p>The exact visual trait that makes North Dakota so unique is
              that entire swaths of it are brighter than its neighbors. That&#8217;s because a
              higher percentage of its census tracts, which are the smallest visual unit in
              the chart, have high internet speeds. It looks overwhelmingly brighter because
              an overwhelming percentage of it <i>is</i> bright. With brightness approaching
              uniformity, North Dakota is different from most coastal states, which have fast
              internet in their capitols and slow internet everywhere else. </p>

              <p>Compare the percentage of census tracts with speeds above 20
              Mbps in North Dakota to the percentage in its southern twin, South Dakota. </p>

              <img width=503 height=433 id="Graphic 1" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/thieme-us-query/477/ND_blog/ND_speed_change.png">

              <p>I&#8217;ve thrown in one of those coastal states, Virginia, for
              comparison. Up until about 2016, North and South Dakota had similar rates of
              census-level high-speed internet adoption. In 2016, though, North Dakota&#8217;s
              tract speeds change completely, turning it into the jewel of Midwestern
              internet. </p>

              <p>What happened? What changed in North Dakota and how that
              plan be copied and pasted throughout the rest of rural America?</p>

              <p>Until the next Great Recession, North Dakota&#8217;s exact formula
              will probably remain out of reach. That&#8217;s because many of the initiatives that
              led to improvements in North Dakota&#8217;s internet came as a result of <span><a href="https://searchmobilecomputing.techtarget.com/definition/Broadband-Technology-Opportunities-Program-BTOP">
                the
              Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP)—</a></span>an initiative
              within the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act passed in response to
              the Great Recession. </p>

              <p><span><a href="https://www2.ntia.doc.gov/north-dakota">
              The BTOP created a</a></span>
              state broadband program office within the North Dakota Information Technology
              Department, paid to install hundreds of miles of high-speed fiber cable, and
              connected several universities in North Dakota to a broader network of
              high-speed &quot;anchor networks.&quot;</p>

              <p>But North Dakota&#8217;s internet surge has another explanation,
              and this one is easier to reproduce. Rural cooperatives made up of local
              service providers are major internet players in North Dakota. The Insititute
              for Local Self-Reliance released a map of rural cooperative internet coverage,
              and on it, North Dakota is as much an outlier as it is on the speed map.</p>

              <p>Coops including the Dickey Rural Telephone Company, the
              Dakota Central Telecommunications Cooperative, <span><a href="http://dakotacarrier.com/about-us/member-companies/">
              and a coop of coops, the Dakota Carrier Network</a></span> (DCN), cover much of North Dakota and
              provide broadband to many of its residents. </p>

              <p>These coops are also closely intertwined with the state
              government&#8217;s closed broadband network STAGEnet. DCN has built out and upgraded
              STAGEnet, helping to bring high-speed internet to government buildings and
              schools, <span><a href="http://dakotacarrier.com/n-d-s-broadband-leadership-benefits-entire-state/">with
              a project in place to make North Dakota the first state with gigabit
              connections in all schools.</a></span> </p>

              <img border=0 width=624 height=536 id="Picture 2" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/thieme-us-query/477/ND_blog/ND_by_isp.png">
              <p>A breakdown of internet speeds by service provider before
              and after 2016 confirms both that coops and government played a huge role in
              the changes, and that the North Dakota internet market is characterized by
              coops. Of the providers whose customers ran over 5000 tests both before and
              after January 2016, the largest improvements were seen by coops and the State
              of North Dakota (STAGEnet). Of those 21 companies, only seven were not involved
              in cooperatives. </p>

              <p>North Dakota&#8217;s unique telecom history has led to internet
              connectivity and speed that other largely rural states have yet to reach, but
              the cooperative nature of North Dakota&#8217;s telecom industry is a central part of
              that history. It&#8217;s not worth suffering another Great Recession to gain the
              internet improvement of the following BTOP-like project, but it&#8217;s also not
              necessary to. A more cooperative internet marketplace seems to do the same just
              fine.</p>
